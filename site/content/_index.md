blurb:
    heading: Why?
    text: "Professionals in the Gallery, Library, Archives, and Museum (GLAM) communities often have roles and job functions that are effectively split between public engagement and care and conservation for collections, both physical and digital. While much is written in the literature about people with public service roles engaging in teaching and outreach, for individuals engaged in working with digital libraries in a GLAM context this has historically been understudied. This study aims to collect information about the outreach and instruction efforts of people engaged in information technology work, as well as engage in analysis of select case studies from a variety of institutions."

    heading: Our values
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
